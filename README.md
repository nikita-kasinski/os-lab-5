### Overview
The app comprises two types of processes: one server and several client processes. Client sends request to server in order to get access to binary file with records. Server is processing the requests. Communication is organized via named pipe.
### Tools
* gcc - compiler
* make - build automation tool
* gtest - library for creating unit tests on c++
* gcov, lcov - tools to test code coverage
### CI/CD
CI/CD is made via Github Actions. There are build and test jobs in the workflow file, which enables project to be built and tested on a clean remote runner.
### Manual running, building, testing and testing code coverage
To perform any listed task several tools and libraries are required:
* gcc
* make 
* gtest (when testing code and code coverage)
* gcov (when testing code coverage)
* lcov (when testing code coverage)

Prepared targets:
* make run - launching the app
* make build - building the app
* make test - running tests
* make report - testing code coverage
